FesSelectionCUDA-package
                        A gene feature selection algorithm.
LRCUDA                  An incremental feature selection algorithm for
                        gene expression profile. We implement it using
                        logistic regression which is accelerated by
                        NVIDIA GPU technology.
f.ratio                 Screen features by fisher's ratio(statistic).
getGPU                  Get GPU device IDs from localhost or a cluster.
rm.bias                 Remove the bias of selected features by iFes.
